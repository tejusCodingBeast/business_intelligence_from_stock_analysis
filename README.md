Abstractâ€”The complexity of the business world has grown to
large extents in the past decade. Business decisions and strategies
have become more difficult to predict whether they achieve their
long term goals or not. However, the business world represents a
dynamic system that can be described as chaotic. This leads us to
inculcating chaos theory in business strategy. This comparison
is not straightforward and it needs a definitive system that is
capable of representing concepts of chaos systems and delivers
on the business side. In order to bridge these two parallels we
use the help of a non-deterministic pushdown automaton. In this
light, the present article aims to build a system which is not
only capable of representing the business world, but also gives
insights on the kind of decisions that need to be taken to ensure
sustainability of the company.
